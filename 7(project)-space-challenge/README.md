# Space Challenge

In this project, you will build a simulation that will help us with our mission to Mars!

The mission is to send a list of items (Habitats, bunkers, food supplies, and rovers) to Mars, but we need to run some simulations first to pick the correct fleet of rockets.

We've already designed 2 rocket prototypes, but we need your help to design and run some simulations to help us decide which type to use.

### U-1
The U-1 Rocket is lightweight, agile and pretty safe, but can only carry a total of 18 tonnes of cargo. It costs $60 Million to build and weighs 10 tonnes. It has a slim chance of crashing while landing but a bigger chance of exploding when launching, both chances depend on the amount of cargo carried in the rocket.

### U-2
The U2 Rocket heavier than the U-1 but much safer and can carry a lot more cargo; to a total of 29 tonnes. However, it costs $120 Million to build and weighs 20 tonnes. It has a greater chance of crashing while landing than while launching, but just like the U-1 both chances depend on the amount of cargo carried.

## The Mission
The mission consists of 2 phases:

### Phase-1:
This phase is meant to send building equipment and construction material to help build the colony. In the resources tab, you will find a text file that contains the list of all items that we need to send called 'Phase-1.txt`. Each line in the file contains the item name as well as its weight in Kgs.


### Phase-2:
This phase is meant to send the colony of humans along with some food resources. In the resources tab, you will find a text file that contains the list of all items that we need to send called 'Phase-2.txt`. Each line in the file also contains the item name and its weight in Kgs.


Your job is to run some simulations and test both rocket types for each phase separately.
